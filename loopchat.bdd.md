# LoopChat Behavior-Driven Development Document

This document defines the behavior specifications for the LoopChat application using Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then format). The behaviors are organized by feature areas.

## Core Application Initialization

```gherkin
Feature: Application Initialization
  As a user
  I want the application to initialize properly
  So that I can start using it immediately

  Scenario: Basic initialization with default settings
    Given the LoopChat application is loaded in a browser
    When the application is initialized without specific parameters
    Then the application should display the default UI
    And the application should show at least one default channel

  Scenario: Initialization with test data
    Given the LoopChat application is loaded in a browser
    When the application is initialized
    Then the application should load test data from test-fixtures.json
    And the application should populate channels based on the test data
    And the application should activate the first channel by default
```

## Channel Management

```gherkin
Feature: Channel Management
  As a user
  I want to view and navigate between channels
  So that I can participate in different conversations

  Scenario: View available channels
    Given the application is initialized with test data
    When I look at the channels panel
    Then I should see a list of available channels
    And each channel should display its title

  Scenario: Switch between channels
    Given the application is initialized with multiple channels
    When I click on a channel in the channel list
    Then that channel should become active
    And the channel content area should update to show that channel's messages
    And the active channel should be visually highlighted

  Scenario: View channel content
    Given a channel is active
    When I look at the channel content area
    Then I should see a header with the channel title and description
    And I should see messages in the channel if any exist
    And I should see a message input area at the bottom
```

## Messaging

```gherkin
Feature: Messaging
  As a user
  I want to send and receive messages
  So that I can communicate within channels

  Scenario: Send a message
    Given I am viewing an active channel
    When I type a message in the input area
    And I press Enter or click the Send button
    Then my message should be added to the channel
    And the message should be displayed in the channel content area
    And the channel should scroll to show the new message

  Scenario: Receive automated response
    Given I have sent a message in a channel
    When the system processes my message
    Then an automated response should be generated
    And the response should appear in the channel content area
    Given the response includes action buttons
    Then the response should include action buttons
```

## Window Management

```gherkin
Feature: Window Management
  As a user
  I want to open, move, minimize, and close windows
  So that I can organize my workspace efficiently

  Scenario: Open a message in a window
    Given I am viewing a channel with messages
    When I click the "Open in Window" button on a message
    Then the message should open in a new window on the desktop area
    And the window should show the message content and any attachments

  Scenario: Move a window
    Given a window is open on the desktop
    When I drag the window header
    Then the window should move with my cursor
    And the window should maintain its new position when released

  Scenario: Minimize a window
    Given a window is open on the desktop
    When I click the minimize button
    Then the window should disappear from view
    And a button for the window should appear in the taskbar

  Scenario: Restore a window
    Given a window is minimized
    When I click its button in the taskbar
    Then the window should reappear on the desktop
    And the window should be brought to the front

  Scenario: Close a window
    Given a window is open on the desktop
    When I click the close button
    Then the window should be removed from the desktop
    And the window should be removed from the application state
```

## Attachment Handling

```gherkin
Feature: Attachment Handling
  As a user
  I want to view different types of attachments
  So that I can access and interact with shared content

  Scenario: View image attachment
    Given a message contains an image attachment
    When I view the message
    Then I should see the image displayed inline
    And the image should have a caption if provided

  Scenario: View code attachment
    Given a message contains a code attachment
    When I view the message
    Then I should see the code displayed in a formatted code block
    And the code block should indicate the language if provided

  Scenario: View file attachment
    Given a message contains a file attachment
    When I view the message
    Then I should see a file icon and caption
    And I should see a link to view or download the file

  Scenario: View chart attachment
    Given a message contains a chart attachment
    When I view the message
    Then I should see a chart icon and caption
    And I should see a preview of the chart if the URL is an image
    And I should see a link to view the chart
```

## UI Responsiveness

```gherkin
Feature: UI Responsiveness
  As a user
  I want the UI to be responsive and provide visual feedback
  So that I can understand the state of the application

  Scenario: Active channel highlighting
    Given multiple channels exist
    When I select a specific channel
    Then that channel's tab should be visually highlighted
    And other channel tabs should not be highlighted

  Scenario: Window focus
    Given multiple windows are open on the desktop
    When I click on a window
    Then that window should be brought to the front
    And that window should have a higher z-index than other windows

  Scenario: Message scrolling
    Given a channel has many messages
    When a new message is added to the channel
    Then the channel content should scroll to show the new message
```

## Extension Points

```gherkin
Feature: Application Extension
  As a developer
  I want clear extension points in the application
  So that I can add new functionality as needed

  Scenario: Adding new attachment types
    Given I am developing new functionality
    When I need to add a new attachment type
    Then I should be able to extend the renderAttachment method
    And the new attachment type should be properly displayed

  Scenario: Customizing channel behavior
    Given I am developing new functionality
    When I need to modify channel behavior
    Then I should be able to extend the channel-related methods
    And the changes should integrate with the existing UI
```

## Data Persistence and Loading

```gherkin
Feature: Data Persistence and Loading
  As a user
  I want my data to be loaded and saved
  So that I can maintain conversation history

  Scenario: Load test data
    Given the application is initialized
    When test data is available
    Then the application should load the test data
    And the channels, users, and agents should be populated from the data

  Scenario: Fallback to defaults
    Given the application is initialized
    When test data is not available or fails to load
    Then the application should create default channels
    And the application should remain functional
```

This BDD document can be extended with additional features and scenarios as the application evolves. It serves as both documentation and a guide for test development to ensure the application behaves as expected.
